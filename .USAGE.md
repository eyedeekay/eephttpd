eephttpd - Static file server automatically forwarded to i2p

usage:
------

eephttpd requires the use of an I2P router with an enabled SAM API.
On the default Java I2P router this is enabled by going to 
[http://localhost:7657/configclients](http://localhost:7657/configclients).

eephttpd recommends the Java I2P router from [geti2p.net](https://geti2p.net)
as the I2P router to use, as that is the router I use to test it. Other options
are [I2P-Zero](https://github.com/i2p-zero/i2p-zero), a minimized distribution
of the Java I2P router with all required dependencies bundled-in, or
[i2pd](https://i2pd.website), a C++ implementation of the I2P network which is
preferred by some power users and sysadmins for it's performance and minimal,
lightweight interface.

If you are using a Linux distribution it is recommended that you use your
package manager to install or uninstall I2P. Java I2P maintains a Debian-style
repository and a PPA for Ubuntu users and up-to-date packages are available in
Debian Sid.

eephttpd is a static http server which automatically runs on i2p with
the help of the SAM bridge. By default it will only be available from
the localhost and it's i2p tunnel. It can be masked from the localhost
using a container.
