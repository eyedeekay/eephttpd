Description: Serving simple static sites directly to i2p via the SAM API.
 eephttpd So, basically everything I put on i2p is a bunch of static
 files. Until now, I tried to host them using darkhttpd(a fork of
 lighttpd from Alpine which functions as a static Web Server) and by
 adding tunnel configuration information to tunnels.conf for i2pd. This
 is easier than manipulating a web interface, but still tedious and kind
 of error-prone. So instead, this serves simple static sites directly to
 i2p via the SAM API.
 .
 to build:
     git clone https://github.com/eyedeekay/eephttpd && cd eephttpd
     go get -u "github.com/eyedeekay/sam-forwarder" go get -u
     "github.com/eyedeekay/sam-forwarder/config" go build
 .
 to run:
     ./eephttpd
 .
 will serve the files from ./www, and store i2p keys in the working
 directory.  Usage (USAGE.md)
